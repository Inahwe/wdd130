        <p>Cross River State is one of Nigeria's 36 states, located in the southeastern part of the country. 
           It was created on May 27, 1967, from the former Eastern Region during Nigeria's state creation exercise. 
           The state was named after the Cross River, which passes through it and forms its southern boundary. Cross River State is home to a diverse population consisting of various ethnic groups, including the Efik, Ibibio, Bekwarra, and Ejagham, among others. 
           Each ethnic group has its own unique traditions, languages, and cultural practices, contributing to the rich tapestry of the state's cultural heritage. Cross River State boasts several tourist attractions, including the Obudu Mountain Resort, which offers breathtaking views, hiking trails, and opportunities for adventure sports. The state is also known for its wildlife reserves, 
           such as the Cross River National Park, which is home to rare species like the Cross River gorilla and the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee.</p>
